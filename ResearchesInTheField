The player firts explores the world and starts to bug hunt (Age of wood and nature, nomads),
then he settels down and uses a nest to gain easier access to starter resources and protection (Age of stone and base building).
After the player has setteled he/she will start to dig after resources (Age of iron and tunnels),
using the iron he can bind the overworld with the underworld and create the first croot sapling to bind it together.
The player enters the age of worship, the player can build worship like structures to gain the favor of the insects, this uses gold.
After a while the player will be granted access to the hive mind and become part of it by using a diamond...
Last stages are reached by using a dragons egg or wither star... the age of the hive swarm

Asymmetric Play to foster teamplay! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQhxtfKH1f8
    - Signaling is important! Context communication!
    - Weak asymmetri inside teams and strong between teams, to complex?

    Vision is to implement a game elements that supports and rewards cooperation 
    without creating dependency between the players (players can still choose dependency) 
    and it shall not punish players for playing alone. The game elements should be 
    innovative and creative and try to stick out more then other features. Without leading
    to creep. Coop support featuers should be based on the player who has achived 
    the highest degree of research, through crafteable items/blocks.


 I was thinking about a block/item... that if one player is online he/she can 
 teleport back to the block.. if they are to they can send sacks back and forth... 
 if they are three they can start sending food, tourches and so on... if they are 
 four then can trade between their inventories. Just a thought.


Machines that have a common interface for smelting and automation and a personal
for the logged in team member, this means that only ppl of the hive can use the hives
machines... This means that you only need one machine to progress in the mod for
all players not one machine for each player! Rewarding cooperation without creating
dependency and is also a new way to tackle teamwork in the FTB packs. 


First beacon home block, let the players to register to a hive... and gives diffrent buffs
and so on...
