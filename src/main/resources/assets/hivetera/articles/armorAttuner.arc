While each clan had their own specialized armor, there was one thing all the clans had in common; they needed a way to place their insects inside of their armor. Lore has it that a traveling engineer was the person to first create the Armor Attuner. He had been staying in the village of one of the clans during the development of their armor, and decided to help them for a small fee. However, once he had created the device that aided the clan, he traveled to the other clans and sold the device to each one. In each village, he claimed that none of the other clans knew of the device, and convinced each clan that it would put them ahead of the others. It was not until many years passed that anyone discovered his trickery.
Use of the device is simple. Once you are wearing a piece of armor, just right click the Attuner in your hand. It will open a GUI where you can place the insects you desire into your armor. However, only certain colored armor will take certain insects (in this book, each insect's entry node corresponds with which armor it is used in).
