The nomads were concerned with the damage their feet sustained during battle, and for this reason they found a way to create boots using Chitin Plates. Some speculate that the boots were originally jugs for drinking that could double as a form of protection. This, however, is only speculation; we do not support the idea of drinking from your boots.
