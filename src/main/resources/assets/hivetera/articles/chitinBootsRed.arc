The 'Crimson Wasps' had everything they could ever wish for, except a pair of red boots. As the raiding kept on, the shamans sat quietly in their tents, experimenting with the clan's insect. As there was no need for the red boots, there was no progress in the research.

It never became a celebrated discovery, however, as the boots were equal to the helmet.
