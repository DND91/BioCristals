The 'Crimson Wasps' started to face challenges during their raid, as families would fight back or flee. Meanwhile, the clans shamans kept experimenting with Water Shielded Beetles and chitin. They soon found a way to infuse the insects aggressiveness inside of the chitin chestplate. This also opened up for something more; they could now start to store banks and food inside the chestplate for the insects. This resulted in the ability to carry more aggressive and dangerous insects.
