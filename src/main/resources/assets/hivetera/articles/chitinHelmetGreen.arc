Far away from the conflicts between the red menace and the blue giants, on another continent lived a clan of thinkers. Rumor has it that they were the creators of every armor pattern, but this has never been proven. The only thing to be surely known is the fact that they were the creators of the green pattern. The clan 'Jaded Dragonflies' did not like insects' active abilities, and instead, sought to use those that were passive. The first green armor piece to be created was the helmet; the creator being one of their leaders. It is said that it was used to increase their ability to think philosophical.
