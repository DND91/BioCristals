The 'Crimson Wasps' were born when a family of nomads tried to breed some Water Shielded Beetles inside of a chitin helmet. By letting the insect breed inside a chitin helmet, the helmet became infused with the aggressive nature of the insects. As they burrow into the armor, the insects create small pockets for other aggressive insects to live. The Armor got discolored in the process and turned either red or crimson. The 'Crimson Wasps' wore the armor filled with all manners of aggressive insects as they raided other families.
