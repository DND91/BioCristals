The clan of the 'Sand Strider' was actually a collection of curious builders. They started out as a small circle of people, and when one of them started to wear a yellow colored helmet, this fashion caught on in a small degree. The results were interesting, as falling blocks would kill the nomads without helmets. After a few years there were only helmet wearing nomads left, and their curiosity grew about the strange helmet they found laying around. Soon they found a crazy nomad they called 'Mirosa The Melon Hunter' who, for fun, created these helmets. He taught the clan how to insert insects into the helmet, and a wild breeding competition began.
