When our ancestors first started experimenting with the Clay Hunters, their initial purpose was to turn different biomaterials into clay. While they found that the clay could be made to smell good as well as even taste good, these discoveries would not help them much in surviving. However, by mixing the insect with a food source, some young biomaterial, and clay, the nomads were able to create a Chitin plate.
They Chitin Plates were used in everything, from armor to nest, and even buildings. Then new found material is stronger than leather, but weaker than iron, and useless when it comes to enchanting. Investigation of the armor suggests that there is room to make it modular.
