As time went on, working the crop fields quickly became a central aspect of the common family life. Because of this, the nomads stopped traveling as frequently, and the insects they obtained we less diverse and harder to find. In shared desperation, one family built a box for the purpose of breeding, and started experimenting. They soon found that the insects could be bred, but for a price.
The breeding box requires two parent insects for gene swapping, as well as a food source; this could be a bank, an eater, or just general food. The last thing that is needed is some sort of nesting material. The insects you breed won't care how the breeding box is placed, as long as all the other requirements are met. Remember, however, that using normal food will be more expensive.
