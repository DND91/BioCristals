Plowing the fields was a time consuming task, and families would often end up with piles of broken tools after a summer's worth of work. Because of this, one family came up with idea to combine a Croot Stick with a Wooden Hoe, creating the first Wooden Croot Hoe. By placing a water block surrounded by dirt, one could use the hoe on the water block and quickly plow a large area of land. Continued use of the hoe causes the plowed area to expand outwards, up to four blocks from the water block.
