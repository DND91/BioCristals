The breeder who discovered the 'Sprinter' was not happy with his results, for the effects of the Sprinter were too obvious. So the breeder tried again, this time breeding a WSB with the more friendly Kitteh Beetle, and provided this new pairing with a feather and a Kraken. The resulting offspring of these insects he named the 'Darter'. This insect's effects were less obvious, for instead of enhancing your natural movement speed like it's sibling the 'Sprinter', the 'Darter' just enhanced your running speed. The breeder was much more pleased with this insect, and slipped it into his armor during the race in secret, resulting in his victory. It was much later that he made this new insect known to the clan. Once he did, some of his fellow clansmen suspected he had used the insect during the race to cheat, although they could never prove it.
