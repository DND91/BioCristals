With more and more insects becoming available to the Jaded Dragonflies, the clan quickly discovered a problem. A lot of their insects aided in movement, however the enhanced speed and easier movement was causing some rather unfortunate accidents. It was when one of the clan's leaders accidentally fell from a cliff ledge and broke his leg that the clan sought a way to give themselves some sort of protection. With a few breeding experiments, they finally bred what would be known as the 'Dragon Shell'. This insect, when placed in armor, protected oneself from any and all fall damage. Now all the clanspeople could walk, jump, and run anywhere without the fear of falling to their doom.
