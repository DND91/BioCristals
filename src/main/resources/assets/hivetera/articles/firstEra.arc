<body><bold>First Era<end>
The 'First Era' is known as the time when resources are scarce. Often we find time trickling away on the little actions made for survival and the constant hunt for food. The 'First Era' is only known to have ended when the nomads settled. Looking back we see a clear connection between humans and nature; as they started to travel, nature started to bend under their creativity and skill.
