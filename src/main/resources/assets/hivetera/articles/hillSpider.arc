The Hill Spider was one of the earliest insects to be breed by the Jaded Dragonflies clan. It was very useful, as it allowed a person to climb up single blocks easily, as if they were simply walking up a set of stairs. The insect became popular with families who had children, as when the children became old enough to don armor, they would use the insect for climbing trees and large hills to impress their friends.
