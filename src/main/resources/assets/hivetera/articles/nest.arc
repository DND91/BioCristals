Since the nomads started to depend on the various bugs they obtained, they wanted a way to protect their insects. As a result, the nomads started building nests to house the little critters. They soon noticed that when the insects were given shelter in the nests, they would thank the nomads by working the environment in their favor, with each different type of insect helping in a different way. When there is nothing to help with, however, the insects will go to sleep.
