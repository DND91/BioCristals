The 'Nomads Sack' was the go-to container for the nomads as they traveled between their settlements, due to it's convenience and it's ability to hold a large amount of items. The bugs inhabiting the bag would often crawl out and retrieve items from the ground as the nomad traveled, bringing the items back to the safety of the sack. This made item collection much easier, though the contents of the bag are not accessible by normal means, as the bugs inhabiting the bag defend the items viciously. To trick these bugs, nomads would shift-right click a chest with the bag in hand to empty the contents into the chest. The use of the sack became rare once the nomads started to settle down, however, as the bag cannot hold large items or any types of tools, rendering the sack almost useless in day-to-day use.
