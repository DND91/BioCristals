It was said that other than breeding new and better insects to use in armor, another thing the Jaded Dragonflies liked to compete in were running sports. It was before a big race that one of the better-known breeders of the clan bred some insects to aid in his pursuit of victory. He first tried breeding a Kraken and WSB together while providing them with sugar and a Kraken, which resulted in the 'Sprinter'. This insect, when placed inside armor, would enhance a person's natural movement speed. While the insect did make a person faster, the breeder, in the end, did not use it for the race, and instead sought to breed an even better insect.
